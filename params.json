Ported by Jeff Verkoeyen under the Apache 2.0 License.\r\n\r\nFrom the fmemopen man page:\r\n\r\n> FILE *fmemopen(void *buf, size_t size, const char *mode);\r\n>\r\n> The fmemopen() function opens a stream that permits the access specified by mode. The stream\r\n> allows I/O to be performed on the string or memory buffer pointed to by buf. This buffer must be\r\n> at least size bytes long.\r\n\r\nAlas, this method does not exist on BSD operating systems (specifically Mac OS X and iOS). It is\r\npossible to recreate this functionality using a BSD-specific method called `funopen`.\r\n\r\nFrom the funopen man page:\r\n\r\n> FILE * funopen(const void *cookie, int (*readfn)(void *, char *, int),\r\n>                int (*writefn)(void *, const char *, int), fpos_t (*seekfn)(void *, fpos_t, int),\r\n>                int (*closefn)(void *));\r\n>\r\n> The funopen() function associates a stream with up to four ``I/O functions''.  Either readfn or\r\n> writefn must be specified; the others can be given as an appropriately-typed NULL pointer.  These\r\n> I/O functions will be used to read, write, seek and close the new stream.\r\n\r\nfmemopen.c provides a simple implementation of fmemopen using funopen so that you can create FILE\r\npointers to blocks of memory.\r\n\r\nAdding it to your Project\r\n=========================\r\n\r\nDrag fmemopen.h and fmemopen.c to your project and add them to your target. `#include \"fmemopen.h\"`\r\nwherever you need to use `fmemopen`.\r\n\r\nExamples\r\n========\r\n\r\n```obj-c\r\n#import \"fmemopen.h\"\r\n\r\nNSString* string = @\"fmemopen in Objective-C\";\r\nconst char* cstr = [string UTF8String];\r\nFILE* file = fmemopen((void *)cstr, sizeof(char) * (string.length + 1), \"r\");\r\n\r\n// fread on file will now read the contents of the NSString\r\n\r\nfclose(file);\r\n```\r\n","tagline":"fmemopen port for iOS and Mac OS X"}
